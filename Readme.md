# Enviro-Economic Assessment of Alternative Fuels in Internal Combustion Engines

## Objective
To evaluate and compare alternative fuels based on engine performance,
CO₂ emissions, and economic impact using enviro-economic analysis.

## Tools & Methods
- Engine performance data analysis
- Caliskan enviro-economic method
- Regression & optimization (Minitab)
- Data visualization (Origin Pro)
- LaTeX technical reporting

## Methodology
- Analyzed engine power and CO₂ emissions across RPM range (1600–4400 RPM)
- Calculated annual CO₂ emissions and carbon cost
- Applied normalization and Enviro-Economic Index (EEI)
- Identified optimal RPM for minimum emissions and cost
- Proposed emission-based taxation policy for transport sector

## Key Results
- Optimal operating range identified at 2400–2800 RPM
- Fuel P optimal at lower RPMs, Fuel Q performs better at higher RPMs
- High RPM increases emissions disproportionately compared to power gain

## Skills Demonstrated
- Engineering data analysis
- Optimization and decision metrics
- Sustainability-focused engineering
- Technical documentation

## Disclaimer
Academic project using secondary engine data for learning and analysis purposes.
